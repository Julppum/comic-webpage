    <hr style="width:200px" class="w3-opacity">
    <p>The world is split between two opposing lands—Mountain and Valley, forever bound by conflict. In the towering peaks of Mountain, life is harsh, forged through ice and stone. Its people are strong, resilient, shaped by the cold winds and the unforgiving terrain. They fight for survival, for dominance, for the right to claim the riches denied to them.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="Mountain" class="image-container">
      <h1 class="medievalsharp-small">Mountain (Anto)</h1>
      <img src="img/mountain_1.png" alt="Image of the Mountain" class="landscape-img">
      <p>According to legend, the war god Anto shaped the mountain’s peak as his dwelling, where he withdrew to spend his final decades as a mortal. His people settled at the mountain’s base and along its slopes, inhabiting the lands sanctified by their god. The Mountain Kingdom is a place of rugged beauty—untouched forests stretch as far as the eye can see along its ridges, while the coastal port is a lively hub of culture and trade. In the capital city of Onsilo, strict discipline and a dignified, protected way of life reign supreme.

        The wolf is the kingdom’s sacred symbol, for Anto was always accompanied by a white wolf in his holy wars. Ancient texts do not fully reveal whether Anto and the wolf were one and the same, but they were always seen together. As a result, wolves are revered and protected throughout the Mountain Kingdom, and killing one without cause is considered dishonorable.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="Valley" class="image-container">
      <h1 class="medievalsharp-small">Valley (Nia)</h1>
      <img src="img/valley_1.png" alt="Image of the Valley" class="landscape-img">
        <p>The Valley once belonged to the Mountain Kingdom, but centuries ago, a conquering people led by their goddess Nia arrived by sea. They landed on the shores and seized the Valley by force, claiming it as their own.

          In summer, the Valley is like paradise—bright flowers bloom in abundance, lush trees tower over the land, and colorful birds fill the skies. In winter, a mystical layer of snow covers everything, turning the landscape into something out of a fairytale.
          
          The Valley’s mines yield far more valuable minerals than the Mountain, making its kingdom more advanced and magnificent. Yet, unfortunately, the common people must admire this grandeur from their shabby homes, never allowed to share in the wealth. The divide between the rich and the poor is stark—the nobility remains behind the mighty wall they built, shielding themselves from the suffering beyond.
          
          The bear is the Valley’s sacred symbol, representing strength and the protection of their goddess Nia. She is believed to watch over her people like a mother bear guarding her cubs.</p>
