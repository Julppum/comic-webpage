                    <h1 class="medievalsharp-small">Alex</h1>
                    <p>Alex is a man in his thirties with blond hair and tanned skin. He is very reserved and secretive about his origins and family. Outwardly, he always appears angry, skeptical, yet undeniably courageous. However, the few who truly know him understand that he is deeply insecure and suffers from the traumas of his past.

                      Alex is an exceptionally skilled fighter, and his weapon of choice is a scythe, much like those who once supported the old order. He is also proficient in sword fighting and archery.
                      
                      His relationship with the divine is fractured. Anto had once blessed his family, but the death of Alex’s father changed his perception of his god. He refuses to follow a power that breaks its promises.</p>

              <div class="c-description">
                  <h1 class="medievalsharp-small">Alexandra</h1>
                  <p>Alexandra is a 24-year-old noblewoman with black hair and very pale skin. She is, in truth, the princess of the valley, but she cannot reveal this little detail to anyone. She is an open, friendly, yet somewhat stubborn woman who cannot tolerate injustice or wrongdoing. She is quick to take action to correct them, even when it may not always be the most rational choice.

                    Alexandra’s family situation has been complicated since the murder of her father. Her uncle seeks power, while Queen Sandra remains deeply depressed. Alexandra has had to take control of the kingdom's affairs, correcting her uncle’s impulsive decisions while also trying to restore her mother’s will to live, as the people still admire her.
                    
                    Alexandra knows she is blessed by her goddess, Nia. However, she does not know why. But the abilities granted by this blessing have proven to be highly beneficial.</p>

              <div class="c-description">
                  <h1 class="medievalsharp-small">Henk</h1>
                  <p>Henk was found by Alex as an infant near the body of a deceased man in the middle of the forest. He was raised by Alex and his adoptive family. However, the young man's restlessness and carefree nature constantly got him into trouble and conflicts with Alex, who had been raised in a completely opposite manner.

                    Henk fled from his growing problems by joining the army. At 160 cm tall, with red hair and a freckled face, he was not seen as a strong candidate for survival—until one person recognized his great potential: the archery trainer, Liekki.
                    
                    Henk experiences an emotional and eventful rollercoaster. With Liekki’s guidance, he learns a great deal about himself, and at times, it feels like Liekki knows him better than he knows himself. But are the things he discovers about himself positive? Soon, Henk finds himself struggling internally—Is he destined to be what he was born as, or is he strong enough to escape it?</p>
